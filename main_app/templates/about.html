<h1>About</h1>
<hr />
<p>I've created this web application to allow a User to Sign Up, Log In, and start planning their days! Once logged in, this application allows the User to select individual days, see the events created by themselves and or other Users events for that day, as well as being able to click on themself or another User's name to see all of their upcoming events.</p>

<p>Please enjoy!</p>
